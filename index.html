    <h1 style="font-size: x-large;">My Dearest Love ❤️,</h1>
    <p>It’s been almost 3 magical years since this journey of “us” began 💍.
We’ve had our share of fights 💢, misunderstandings, and stubborn silences…
But one thing has always stayed strong —
Our love. Deep, wild, unshakable love 💞.
No matter what happens, we never give up on each other, and that’s what makes our bond so rare and real 🫂✨.

Do you remember our school days? 🏫
You — the calm, focused, soft-spoken girl 🧘‍♀️...
Me — the naughty boy who never obeyed the teachers 😜👦🏻.
But somewhere between those stolen glances 😍 and silly laughs 🤭,
You became the most beautiful part of my world 💖.
Our school wasn’t just a place of learning —
It became the first chapter of our love story 📖❤️.

We made those benches, classrooms, and corridors come alive with emotions 🎒.
Even when we didn’t speak, our eyes spoke everything 🥺.
Our memories from those days still echo in my heart…
Sweet, innocent, pure — like first love is meant to be 🕊️.

But love wasn’t always easy…
I still remember that phase — when we got caught by your parents 😔.
It was my 12th board exam time — and I was completely lost.
I couldn’t see you, couldn’t talk to you,
And still, you were the only one on my mind the whole morning 🌅💭.
I tried to study… but my heart was heavy 💔.
Then at night, I used to calm my soul thinking,
“Maybe she’s sleeping peacefully now…” 😌🌙
That thought alone gave me strength.
I studied through the nights, with just one goal —
To build a good future, a life with you 🏠🎓💕

And you know what? I did it.
I scored well, and I had a choice — to pick my path, my college.
Then came the news…
You’ll be studying in Chennai. 🌆
That’s when I knew — this isn’t coincidence, this is fate.
So I chose Chennai too — not just for education,
But because my heart wanted to be near yours 🫶.

Now even if we meet once in months,
Even if it’s just for a short while,
That one moment becomes a lifetime of happiness for me 💑✨.
Because our love is not ordinary…
It’s a bond made from school memories, hidden tears, secret dreams, and undying hope 🌈♾️.

You + Me — we may not be perfect,
But we’re perfect for each other 💖.
So no matter how many fights, no matter the distance…
I’ll always be your Aji — your crazy, loving, emotional Aji 🥹💌.

Let’s grow old with these memories,
And create new ones, together —
With love, laughter, tears, and forever promises 🤝❤️.

Forever yours,
Aji 😘</p>
